"""The injected seam the whole graph runs on (house style, cf. `quotes.fetch`).

One graph, three wirings of the SAME `AgentContext`:
  * tests  -> a stub chat model, no network (deterministic, the graded layer);
  * `langgraph dev` / Studio -> the real gateway `ChatOpenAI` + seeded local data;
  * deploy -> gateway model + Postgres/Qdrant-backed loaders.

Real wirings must build the chat model with `tags=["nostream"]`: no LLM call in
this graph is user-facing (delivery is audit-gated; visible messages are
constructed in code), so any streamed model tokens leak scoper JSON / unaudited
drafts into the client's `messages` stream as extra chat bubbles. `dev.py` does
this; the deploy wiring must too.

Per-user DATA (snapshot, ledger, policy) is loaded inside nodes keyed by
`user_id`, not baked into this frozen context — the server compiles the graph
once and serves every user. Those data-access callables land with the pre-fetch
node (Slice 2); the scoper needs only the chat model, so that is all Slice 1
requires here. Desk retrieval is not a field: it enters as a tool in
`agent_tools` (built by `dev.py` / the deploy wiring around the retriever).
