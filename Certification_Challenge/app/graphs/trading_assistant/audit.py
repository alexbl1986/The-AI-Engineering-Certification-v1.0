"""Deterministic audit node (ADR-0006, step 5) — code, never the LLM.

The one rule enforced here: every dollar amount and percentage in the answer must
trace to a number in the draft's grounding (the deterministic fact digest plus
every tool result on the thread). A figure that appears nowhere in the evidence is
a fabrication — the classic "confident wrong number" this app exists to prevent, and
the cold-start guarantee (no portfolio number when its store was never uploaded)
falls out for free, since a missing store contributes no numbers to the grounding.

Bare integers (years, strikes, option counts) are not audited — only $ and %,
the figures that carry compliance weight. One bounce back to the answer node
(tools off) with the offending figures, then deliver with a warning banner.

Rule-citation and quote-availability checks (also ADR-0006 step 5) arrive with the
policy record and live quotes in later slices.
