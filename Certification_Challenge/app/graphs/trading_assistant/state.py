"""Graph state and the scoper's structured output (ADR-0006).

`AgentState` is the single reasoning context that flows through the graph:
intake/scoper -> deterministic pre-fetch -> answering agent (tool loop on the
`messages` thread) -> audit. Slice 1 populates only `messages` and `scope`;
later slices add the evidence table, the audit-gated draft, and audit result.

`Scope` is the scoper node's structured output: a MULTI-LABEL intent (one message
can be both "am I within policy?" and "what does the desk think?"), the entities
we extract deterministically downstream, and the `hypothetical` flag that keeps
"if I raised my cap to 12%…" an analysis, never a policy write.
