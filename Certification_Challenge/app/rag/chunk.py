"""Adaptive, structure-aware chunking for the desk reviews (build_plan / ADR-0004).

The reviews carry no fixed template, so we chunk on the layout signal instead:
the per-doc char-weighted modal font size is the body, anything ~2pt larger is a
heading, and a chunk is the body between consecutive headings. Long sections are
packed to a character budget and repeated page furniture (headers/footers) is
dropped. Table regions arrive from extraction as pipe-joined row lines, so a
chunk keeps each name on the same row as its desk action.

The section heading is **prepended into the searchable text** of every chunk
(so BM25/dense can match on it) and is *also* kept as the ``section`` metadata
field for citation. Other metadata — source, chunk_id, review_date, doc_type,
pages — follows the course conventions in 01_Dense_Vector_Retrieval /
07_Advanced_Retrievers.
